# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have attempted to complete the pracs earlier in the week, however have not yet been able to as my other subjects have had multiple assesment items due over the past weeks

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Try to find time earlier in the week to start the pracs or read over what is needed each week. Also need to learn how to properly use the pull requests as they are still a bit confusing.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Managing to submit each week

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

stop starting tasks before reading fully through the task sheet for them.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would have liked a little more explanation on how to actually use pull requests and how to merge them back as it was confusing and i was not sure if it was working or not
