# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About This Project
This repository contains my practical work for **CP1404 – Programming II** at **James Cook University**.  
Each folder (e.g. `prac_01`, `prac_02`, etc.) includes Python programs and exercises demonstrating weekly programming concepts such as loops, functions, classes, file handling, and clean code practices.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Follow the [CP1404 Style Guide](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Style-Guide) and use PyCharm’s *Reformat Code* to keep code clean and readable.
- Variable, function, and class names should clearly describe their purpose, making code self-documenting.  
- Avoid duplicating code by using functions and loops to handle repeated logic.  
- Write, test, and commit small changes regularly instead of large, untested jumps.
