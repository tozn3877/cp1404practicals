# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
My estimate accuracy was not good as sometimes it would take way longer than I estimated


### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
I noticed that my estimates would be influenced by how incorrect or correct I was with my previous estimate

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned that trying to estimate how long I will take is normally difficult as there is many factors that impact the time needed.


## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
That having another person look at your code could possibly catch things that could be done better


### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Each person seems to have a slightly different way about going about things such as commit messages and how they complete tasks


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Week 8 Code review](https://github.com/MichaelRozis/cp1404practicals/pull/3)


### Explanation

This review was good as I had well written comments that suggested ways to do stuff differently.

### Good Code Review 2

[Week 9 Code review](https://github.com/elijahwalkerrr/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

This review was good as I was able to compare my code to theirs and suggest ways to alter things to improve them.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Somehow make each weeks practical shorter as it has been quite difficult to fit in time to complete each weeks prac with my other subjects

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I managed to get decent marks each week by trying my best to follow the tasks.
